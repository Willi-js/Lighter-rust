# Lighter

Lighter is my passion project. My work is currently focused on Digital Audio Workstation (DAW).
At its current stage, Lighter is far from being complete and usable. I have conceptualized its core idea, but the full implementation is still pending. Given that Lighter is a labor of love, I am committed to investing my utmost effort, refraining from hastiness to avoid creating a hastily executed project. This is also my first project written in rust, as I am learning the language on the way it slows down the developement of Lighter even further, but anyhow hopefuly in the future it will become something useful.
